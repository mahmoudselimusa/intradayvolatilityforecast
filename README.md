# intradayvolatilityforecast

My project focuses on intraday volatility forecasting using high-frequency equity market data. I chose this project because volatility is a core input to risk management, execution, and trading decisions, and it presents and interesting time-series modeling problem. I engineered statistical features from intraday returns, built, and evaluated forecasting models.
